# Accessibility

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Accessible design lets people of all abilities interact with, understand, and navigate our products.

{% tab title="Introduction" %}
Accessibility means that people can do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone fully abled. It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed or implemented.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Our Approach to Accessibility" %}
Here at our product we comply to all levels of accessibility, to put it in a different words all people from anywhere on earth can access our website and make use of the services that we provide.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Our project is different than what exists in the market as it should provide more services, all in one product for different people with different disabilities such as blid color people.

We have explain what color and what resources we will use in [Mock-Ups section](https://eskandar-atrakchi.gitbook.io/team-project-proposal/mock-ups/icons).
